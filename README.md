# convolutional-neural-net
A CNN implemented in MATLAB for CMPEN454: Computer Vision in Fall 2016

HOW TO RUN:

Debug() will run the debugging output to make sure that the output from each layer is correct using debuggingTest.mat

Main() will run the CNN on each of the 10000 images in the cifar data set and output a confusion matrix.

CustomTest() will read all of the images in the custom_test directory and attempt to classify them
